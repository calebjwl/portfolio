  <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
  <p class="bio">
    I am a freelance web developer based in Nashville, Tennessee.
    My passion for computer science began with my love for audio engineering and the art of utilizing technologies
    to innovate the world as we experience it. After a semester of studying Computer Science at Belmont University,
    I devoted three months to learning front-end development at the Iron Yard coding bootcamp in Nashville.
    Throughout the intensive program, I gained experience with working in teams of both front-end and back-end developers,
    GitHub flow, and agile project planning. Since my graduation from the Iron Yard, I have been working as a freelance
    developer, building websites for businesses and companies of various scales.
